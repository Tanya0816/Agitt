Chainlink VRF

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the  security considerations  in mind.

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)  is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified onchain before any consuming applications can use it. This process helps ensure that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, smart contract developers, users, miners, or block builders*.

*In the unlikely event that an adversary compromises VRF's randomness-generating secret key and obtains the ability to construct blocks on the target chain, they could strongly bias the result.

Migrate to V2.5

Follow the  migration guide  to learn how VRF has changed in V2.5 and to get example
code.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that rely on unpredictable outcomes:

Building blockchain games and NFTs.

Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.

Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

VRF v2.5 includes  all the original benefits of v2  and the following additional benefits:

Easier upgrades to future versions.

The option to pay for requests in either LINK or native tokens.

Two methods to request randomness

Similarly to VRF v2, VRF v2.5 will offer two methods for requesting randomness:

Subscription : Create a subscription account and fund its balance with either native tokens or LINK. You can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.

Direct funding : Consuming contracts directly pay with either native tokens or LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough funds to pay for randomness requests.

Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another. Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

Subscription method

Direct funding method

Currently available on VRF v2.5 for all supported networks.  Currently available on VRF v2.5 for all supported networks.

Suitable for regular requests  Suitable for infrequent one-off requests

Supports multiple VRF consuming contracts connected to one subscription account  Each VRF consuming contract directly pays for its requests

VRF costs are calculated after requests are fulfilled and then deducted from the subscription balance. Learn  how VRF costs are calculated for the subscription method .  VRF costs are estimated and charged at request time, which may make it easier to transfer the cost of VRF to the end user. Learn  how VRF costs are calculated for the direct funding method .

Reduced gas overhead and more control over the maximum gas price for requests  Higher gas overhead than the subscription method

More random values returned per single request. See the maximum random values per request for the  V2.5 subscription supported networks .  Fewer random values returned per single request than the subscription method, due to higher overhead. See the maximum random values per request and gas overhead for the  V2 direct funding supported networks .

You don't have to estimate costs precisely for each request. Ensure that the subscription account has enough funds.  You must estimate transaction costs carefully for each request to ensure the consuming contract has enough funds to pay for the request.

Requires a subscription account  No subscription account required

VRF costs are billed to your subscription account  No refunds for overpayment after requests are completed

Supported networks

The contract addresses and gas price limits are different depending on which method you use to get randomness. You can find the configuration, addresses, and limits for each method on the  Supported networks  page.
